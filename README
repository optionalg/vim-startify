STARTIFY

Startify basically provides two things:

1)  If you start Vim without giving any filenames to it (or pipe stuff to it so
   it reads from STDIN), startify will show a small but pretty start screen
   which shows recently used files and sessions by default.

   Additionally, you can define bookmarks, thus entries for files that always
   should be available in the start screen.

   You can either navigate to a certain menu entry or you just key in whatever
   is written between the square brackets on that line.

2)  It eases handling of loading and saving sessions by only working with a
   certain directory. Two commands are used for convenience:

      :SLoad    load a session
      :SSave    save a session

The default settings are pretty sane, so it should work without any
configuration.
